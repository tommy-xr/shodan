- Add multi-line scripts

- Workflow: JS / Bash nodes (Take .js and .sh respectively)
- Workflow: Simple execution with just bash nodes -> incrementally wire up other nodes

- Fix agent models
- Create template syntax {{ }} when an input is available
- Initial CLI command
- Add a container component (a "microchip") that has input and outputs, but an interior workflow. Double-clicking on the container component allows for editing internals. Can be recursive and copy-pasted or created as a template
- Validate an end-to-end flow with only scripts (ie, echo)

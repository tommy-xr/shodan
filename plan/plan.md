- Workflow: JS / Bash nodes (Take .js and .sh respectively)
- Fix agent models - we might want to make an API request and query each tool respectively?
- Add clearly defined input/output for the agent blocks - the inputs can be used as template variabels, and the output can be added to the prompt we send the agent. We can then wire the output directly elsewhere
- Add a container component (a "microchip") that has input and outputs, but an interior workflow. Double-clicking on the container component allows for editing internals. Can be recursive and copy-pasted or created as a template
- How to use / re-use session id?
